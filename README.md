# lovesay

lovesay is a simple and lightweight python script that displays a quote from a loved one based on the day of the month

### Requirements

- python3 or greater
- termcolor for python:
```pip install termcolor```
or
```pip3 install termcolor```
- A quotes file stored in the .config folder
- Each quote must be on a new line, see the example quotes file in .config/quotes
- (optional) A partner to write you 31 lines full of love, one for each day of the month

### Usage 

lovesay is a very simple script, once all the requirements are taken care of, it can be ran by using:   
```
python3 /path/to/lovesay.py
```
by default, it checks for the quotes file at ```.config/quotes``` but that can be changed quite easily in the script itself

### About lovesay

I wrote lovesay because I got tired of seeing neofetch or pfetch everytime I opened my terminal. I wanted something more personal. 

Seeing words full of love from my partner is a lot better than any other command I could possibly run. It makes my terminal feel cozy, welcoming, and as is the case with most things my partner touches, it makes my terminal feel like home. 

I hope that someone else finds a use for this little script as well. Love is a wonderful thing, and we could all use a little bit more of it in our lives (especially arch linux users)
